#First Week of Bootcamp!

## Learning to Code at Awesome Inc. 


It's been an interesting first week here at Awesome Inc. and the coding bootcamp they provide. My brain has been challenged but overall it has been a really fun experience. This week we focused on fundamentals and I finally became more comfortable with the command line and using git. We also discovered the joys of SASS paired with Gulp, a process I am still getting used to using. 

I joined this bootcamp to better my skills both as a designer and as a web developer. My experience in coding up until this point has been pretty basic and I wanted to be able to create more complex projects. 

The most interesting thing I learned this week was finally getting the hang of using the command line in conjunction with github. Using the push and pull methods to both send and receive information and share it with my classmates has been both confusing and interesting to learn.
